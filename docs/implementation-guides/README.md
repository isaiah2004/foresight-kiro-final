- Benefits of centralized configuration approach

**Prerequisites:** Basic TypeScript knowledge

## Implementation Workflow

### Recommended Order
1. **Start with Project Initialization** - Set up the foundation
2. **Follow React Best Practices** - Understand the development patterns
3. **Implement Dashboard Setup** - Create the main application structure
4. **Apply Configuration Management** - Organize shared data and settings
5. **Add AI Integration** - Implement advanced features (Phase 2)

### Development Process
Each guide follows this structure:
1. **Prerequisites** - What you need before starting
2. **Step-by-step Instructions** - Detailed implementation steps
3. **Code Examples** - Working code snippets and configurations
4. **Verification** - How to test and validate the implementation
5. **Troubleshooting** - Common issues and solutions
6. **Next Steps** - What to implement next

## Code Standards

### TypeScript Requirements
- All code examples use TypeScript with strict type checking
- Interfaces and types are provided for all data structures
- Generic types are used where appropriate for reusability

### Component Patterns
- Server Components by default, Client Components only when needed
- Single Responsibility Principle for all components and functions
- Proper error boundaries and loading states
- Accessibility considerations in all UI components

### Performance Guidelines
- Optimize for Core Web Vitals (LCP, FID, CLS)
- Use Suspense with skeleton loaders
- Implement proper caching strategies
- Lazy load components with next/dynamic

### Testing Approach
- Unit tests for business logic and utilities
- Integration tests for component interactions
- End-to-end tests for critical user journeys
- Performance tests for financial calculations
