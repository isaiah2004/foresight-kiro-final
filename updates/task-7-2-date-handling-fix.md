# Date Handling Fix for Investment Management

**Date**: December 7, 2024  
**Issue**: TypeError: investment.purchaseDate.toLocaleDateString is not a function  
**Status**: Fixed  

## Problem

When investment data was stored in localStorage and then retrieved, Date objects were being serialized to strings. When the data was parsed back from localStorage, the `purchaseDate` and `lastSyncTimestamp` fields remained as strings instead of being converted back to Date objects.

This caused a runtime error when trying to call `.toLocaleDateString()` on a string value in the investment overview component.

## Root Cause

```javascript
// When storing to localStorage
localStorage.setItem(`investments_${user.id}`, JSON.stringify(investments))

// When retrieving from localStorage
const storedInvestments = JSON.parse(stored) // Dates become strings
```

JSON serialization converts Date objects to ISO string format, but `JSON.parse()` doesn't automatically convert them back to Date objects.

## Solution

### 1. Fixed Data Loading in Hook (`src/hooks/use-investments.ts`)

```typescript
// Before (problematic)
const storedInvestments: Investment[] = stored ? JSON.parse(stored) : []

// After (fixed)
const storedInvestments: Investment[] = stored ? JSON.parse(stored).map((inv: any) => ({
  ...inv,
  purchaseDate: new Date(inv.purchaseDate),
  lastSyncTimestamp: new Date(inv.lastSyncTimestamp)
})) : []
```

### 2. Added Defensive Programming in Component (`src/components/shared/investments/investment-overview.tsx`)

```typescript
// Before (vulnerable to string dates)
{investment.purchaseDate.toLocaleDateString()}

// After (handles both Date objects and strings)
{new Date(investment.purchaseDate).toLocaleDateString()}
```

### 3. Cleaned Up Unused Imports

Removed unused imports (`PieChart`, `Plus`, `Activity`) from the investment overview component to eliminate linting warnings.

## Files Modified

- `src/hooks/use-investments.ts` - Fixed date parsing when loading from localStorage
- `src/components/shared/investments/investment-overview.tsx` - Added defensive date handling and cleaned imports

## Testing

- ✅ Build successful with no TypeScript errors
- ✅ No runtime errors when displaying investment dates
- ✅ Proper date formatting in investment overview
- ✅ New investments still work correctly with proper Date objects

## Prevention

This fix ensures that:
1. **Data Loading**: Dates are properly converted back to Date objects when loading from localStorage
2. **Defensive Programming**: Components can handle both Date objects and date strings
3. **Type Safety**: Maintained proper TypeScript typing throughout

## Future Considerations

When implementing Firebase integration, ensure proper date handling:
- Use Firestore Timestamp objects for dates
- Convert Timestamps to Date objects when loading data
- Maintain consistent date handling across all data sources
